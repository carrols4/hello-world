A repository for schoolwork

Hello!

I am a student at Milwaukee area technical college. I first got interested in Information Technology because I was always curious about the technology around me and how it worked. 

In my free time, I enjoy Sewing and watching anime. I have one dog named Peter. I also have three cats named Midnight, Daiquiri, and Long Island. 

Thanks for reading! Have a great day!

This is an example of how branches are used in a repository.
